## Design Analysis

Analysis done at desktop width (1920).

Liberal use of all the C.R.A.P principles (Contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity).

#### General

The page uses two main fonts; one for headings and one for body text. The font used for headings is a hand-drawn "grotesk vernacular", and is reasonably playful and decorative for a serif. It has a classy comic sans feel, without the inconsistent sizing and spacing. Using this kind of font for a heading seems to try and convey a sense of welcoming or fun.

The body font by contrast is a no - nonsense serif that is plain, reads well and has small decorations. It's perhaps optimised for readability, and to add a sense of authorative information and expertise despite the less serious headings.

The contrast between the two fonts definitely make titles and headings stand out despite their size.

#### Section 1 - Splash / Landing

Three articles on the left and a newsletter sign up form on the right. The articles use alignment, repetition of elements and proximity to each other to form a cohesive and thematic whole, and the position and larger size of the top article give it some more weight and contrast. Within the article cards elements' colour, boldness and size help establish their hierarchy.

#### Section 4 - Guides

#### Section 5 - Featured Book
